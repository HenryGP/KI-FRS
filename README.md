Kinect Integrated - Face Recognition System (KI-FRS)

======

This project was developed as part of my bachelor thesis for Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia (Spain) and Universidad de Belgrano (Argentina) as part of double degree agreement between both institutions.

This is ongoing project for anybody who wants to continue further investigation on this branch.

1.- Installation:
    If you are fortunate enough to own a Kinect and want to test the code from this project first you will have to         install a bunch of specific packages and libraries to make it work.
    Installation process covers dependencies, Openkinect and OpenCV installation. Python and Numpy must be already         installed.
    For Linux platforms is as simple as running a basic bash file. Just follow these simple instructions:
        - Open command prompt and place on project folder directory.
        - Type "chmod +x setup.sh" and "./setup.sh" later. This will execute a series of commands of necessary software           to make the system work.
        - Enjoy
